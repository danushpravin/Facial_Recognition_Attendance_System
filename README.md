## Face-Based Attendance System

A Python and OpenCV-based system that automatically marks attendance by recognizing faces in real time.  
The system captures faces, trains a recognition model, and logs attendance into subject-wise CSV files.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
To automate attendance marking using facial recognition, reducing manual errors and saving time in classrooms or offices.

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9**
- **OpenCV** for face detection and recognition (LBPH algorithm)
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data processing and attendance storage
- **CSV Files** for attendance records

---

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works
1. **Face Registration** â€“ Captures multiple images of each student to build a training dataset.
2. **Model Training** â€“ Uses LBPH algorithm to convert faces into numeric features for recognition.
3. **Automatic Attendance** â€“ Recognizes faces in real time using a webcam and marks attendance in CSV files.
4. **Attendance Logging** â€“ Creates a subject-wise record of attendance with timestamps.

## ðŸ“Œ My Contribution
- Developed the **end-to-end system** for face recognition and attendance marking.
- Implemented the **face detection, dataset generation, and LBPH recognition pipeline**.
- Built a **GUI for registering students and viewing attendance**.
- Created the **subject-wise attendance logging system** using CSV.

---

## âœ… Outcomes
- Successfully implemented a **fully functional face-recognition attendance system**.
- Improved **speed and reliability** of attendance marking with automated data logging.
- Gained practical experience in **computer vision, Python scripting, and OpenCV face recognition**.
